# all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you
It's my own personal torture device!
   
This bot plays mp3s from the `songs` directory randomly and on loop forever.
  
Intended for use from 1 November to 31 December to play All I Want For Christmas Is You (and assorted joke variants) so the bot is named as such.  
  
If you're here, you probably know what to do. Run `npm i`, pop your user ID and bot token into `config.json` and give it a crack and then weep when it probably just works.  
    
Obviously, I can't supply these mp3s, but you'll probably find ones that work for you pretty easily. 
  
May god help your soul.
